These scripts convert a character separated value file into the plsa or lda counts format, and convert between the two formats

for plsa the inout format is:
<line (1 line per document)> = <doc ID> <word>|<count>...

and for lda it is:

<line (1 line per document)> = | <word Idx>:<count>...

a vocabulary file (required for lda_chow)
<line> = <word>
where the line # matches the word index for that word
